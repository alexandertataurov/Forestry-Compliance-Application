### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
1. Define business objectives and security requirements
2. Define technical scope and architecture
3. Application decomposition and analysis
4. Threat analysis and enumeration
5. Vulnerability analysis and correlation
6. Attack enumeration and simulation
7. Risk impact analysis and recommendations
